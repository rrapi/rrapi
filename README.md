### AI and Robotics Engineer

I am an expert in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and I have a growing passion for Autonomous Driving, Space Shuttles and Technology. My multicultural background paired with international experiences and the passion for traveling have allowed me to develop fluent and proficient languages knowledge. As an intrinsically curious person, I endeavor to consistently apply my skills, knowledge and strengths to new challenges and unfamiliar problems such that I may continually grow personally and professionally.
